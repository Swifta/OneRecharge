# OneRecharge

One Recharge is a system that allows users and agents perform recharge transactions on their mobile
phones.

Knowing full well that the Virtual Airtime top up in the country has not fully been harnessed to its potential, OneRecharge速 is one application that can bridge this gap and further expand the outreach of Virtual Top up. Such bottlenecks like occasional unavailability of recharge cards and/or agents and the time consuming mundane task of having to move around to buy airtime can be eradicated through the sales of all network airtime from a common platform. 

One-Recharge速 is a product that promises to vend airtime from different networks using a common platform. The platform will be a gateway to all vending platforms across all networks to One-Recharge速 users to top up their accounts from different networks. The targeted users are subscribers of these different Telcos and their respective agents as this will come at an advantage not only for subscribers, but also for agents as they will be able to dispense airtime to subscribers via a single transacting account. 

This way, an agent does not have to be registered on all networks. They can do this through the use of a single point of sales or account on OneRecharge速.
